# Heart-Failure-prediction-using-ML
In my heart failure prediction project, I utilized a dataset containing clinical records to develop machine learning models aimed at predicting patient outcomes. I began with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and identify any anomalies, such as duplicate entries and missing values. The dataset comprised 5,000 entries with 13 features, including patient age, medical conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and laboratory results. I ensured the data was clean by removing duplicates and conducting a thorough analysis of the feature distributions.

Following the EDA, I visualized the data to highlight key distributions and relationships among variables. I employed various visualization techniques, including count plots, pie charts, and histograms, to better understand the characteristics of both categorical and continuous variables. Additionally, I created pivot tables and cross-tabulations to analyze the relationships between different features, particularly focusing on how they related to the target variable, DEATH_EVENT.

To build the predictive models, I split the dataset into training and testing sets, applying techniques to address class imbalance using the SMOTE algorithm. I implemented several machine learning classifiers, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and evaluated their performance based on accuracy scores. Ultimately, the Random Forest classifier yielded the highest accuracy, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in predicting heart failure outcomes.
